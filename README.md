DDS 6306 Wine Quality Project
Wine quality is a multifaceted attribute influenced by a myriad of factors, including chemical properties, production techniques, and environmental conditions. The goal of this data science project is twofold:
1.	Objective A: Build a predictive model that minimizes the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the test set.
2.	Objective B: Analyze the data to uncover key factors that contribute to high-quality wine, providing actionable insights for vintners to enhance their production processes.
